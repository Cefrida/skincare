## Skincare Recommender Tool
# Overview
Online skincare shopping can be overwhelmingâ€”especially when you're faced with dozens of similar products and limited filters like price or rating. This tool aims to simplify the process by offering a smarter way to compare skincare products, taking into account your skin type and other priorities like product category, price, and rating.

Unlike typical e-commerce filters, this recommender uses over 600,000 reviews from real users.
